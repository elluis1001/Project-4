About Dataset:

The Diabetes prediction dataset is based on the original dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of Johns Hopkins University in which the objective is to accurately predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset takes several diagnostic measurements into consideration. In this dataset, the measurements are number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thinkness, insulin levels, Body Mass Index (BMI), Diabetes Pedigree Function or diabetic family history, age, and outcome. We will demonstrate how this dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical information. This model can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes. However, this dataset is limited regarding the variety and diversity of the participants especially in relation to gender and ethnic background as all the patients included in the original dataset are women who are 21 years of age and above. Also, all the patients are of Pima Indian Hertiage. However, dispite these limitations, we are certain this predictive model to be use to considerable effect to potential assisting medical professionals treating patients who are at risk or are diagnosed with diabetes.
