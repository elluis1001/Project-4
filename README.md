About Dataset:

The Diabetes prediction dataset is based collection of medical and demographic data from patients. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are the primary source of data for the Diabetes Prediction dataset. EHRs are digital versions of patient health records that contain information about their medical history, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. The data in EHRs is collected and stored by healthcare providers, such as hospitals and clinics, as part of their routine clinical practice. Using this dataset has a number of advantages. Those adavatages include that EHRs contain a large amount of patient data including demographic and clinical information which can be used to develop accurate machine learning models. EHRs also provide a view of a patient's health over time, which can be used to identify patterns and trends in their health status. Because EHRs are widely used in clinical practice, making the Diabetes Prediction dataset relevant to real-world healthcare settings. The objective is to accurately predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on the diagnostic measurements. The dataset takes several diagnostic measurements into consideration. In this dataset, gender, blood glucose levels, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, Body Mass Index (BMI), HbA1c level, and age. We will demonstrate how this dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical information. This model can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.
